1. Granular view #1 - Display all geomean 
SELECT 
    exp_date, benchmark_suite, benchmark_item, engine, version, config,
    machine, metric_type, avg FROM summary
WHERE 
    exp_label = 'NIGHTLYRUN' AND benchmark_item = "GEOMEAN"


2. Fine view #2 - show for all selected data range
SELECT 
    exp_date, benchmark_suite, benchmark_item, engine, version, config,
    machine, metric_type, avg FROM summary
WHERE 
    exp_data BETWEEN value1 AND value2 AND exp_label = 'NIGHTLYRUN' AND benchmark_item != "GEOMEAN"
    

3. Fine view #3 - show violin plot for one DATE and one benchmark suite
SELECT
    percentile_95,
    min,
    max,
    metric_type,
    engine, 
    version,
    config,
    machine,
WHERE 
    exp_data = value1 AND exp_label = 'NIGHTLYRUN' AND benchmark_suite = value2 AND benchmark_item != "GEOMEAN"


Note: The API Server currently has slightly modified queries, since the database does not have "GEOMEAN" values yet.
"GEOMEAN" is a tag assigned to "benchmark_item" column in the SUMMARY table, to store the geometric mean for each 
engine + config across all "benchmark_item" in a "benchmark_suite".

Once the geometric mean values are added to the database, with the corresponding "benchmark_item" column storing string
"GEOMEAN", the API queries should be replaced with the above mentioned queries.
