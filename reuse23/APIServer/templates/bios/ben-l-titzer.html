        <p>Ben is a Principal Researcher in the Software and Societal Systems Department at Carnegie Mellon University. His research 
            focuses on systems; systems programming languages, compilers, virtual machines, and managed runtime systems, as well as the higher-level systems that they support. 
            In 2014, Ben co-founded <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, and now focuses on increasing WebAssembly's usefulness 
            and reach for academic research as well as applicability to new domains such as Edge computing.
        </p> 
        <p>Ben is building a new WebAssembly en engine for research and experimentation! Called The <a href="https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine/">Wizard Engine</a>, 
            it focuses on simplicity and flexibility, while still having competitive performance. Itâ€™s small and well-suited for students to learn how Wasm engines work. 
            It already has a few innovative features and line-for-line is featureful yet easy to read.
